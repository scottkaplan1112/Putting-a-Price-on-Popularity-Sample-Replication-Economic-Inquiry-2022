# Putting-a-Price-on-Popularity-Sample-Replication-Economic-Inquiry-2022
This repository contains contents for replicating certain results from the paper “Putting a Price on Popularity: Evidence from Superstars in the National Basketball Association.” In particular, it provides replication for one of the superstar players analyzed in the paper, Stephen Curry. This replication procedure applies to all remaining players, for which data is not included. This data has been pre-processed from its original form to include some additional variables needed to conduct the analysis, but the raw components of the data are included from their original state. All analysis has been done using RStudio, and necessary packages and libraries needed are included in the respective files attached and described below.
